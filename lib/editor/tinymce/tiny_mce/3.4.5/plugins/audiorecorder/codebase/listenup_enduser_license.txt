1. Mobileer.com, (the "Company") grants you (the "Customer") a worldwide, non-
exclusive, restricted right and license to use the accompanying ListenUp SDK 
(the "Software"), in binary executable form, solely for the purpose of providing

browser.

The Software consists of:

The price of the license fee is available from the Company at "http://www.javasonics.com/sales/". 

2. The Customer use of the Software is subject to the following restrictions:

- The Customer may not interfere with the display or functionality of the 
advertisement for ListenUp when runing in Free Mode. The Applet will display a 
message about ListenUp and provide a button that can take the user to the 
ListenUp website.

sold to other companies or organizations without the Company's prior written
permission.
