This plugin is based on several technologies: Java, JavaScript, PHP (of course!) Flash and FFMPEG cli

This plugins is mostly based on the Java Recorder applet from project: listenup (http://www.javasonics.com/)
current javasonics license allows for 1 minute recording for a non-commercial website use.
For commercial use and longer recording times, please contact Javasonic.

Users mush have a W3C standard compliant browser to use this plugin with updated Java 1.6 and Flash 10.x installed.
On the server side, for converting from WAV to MP3, you will have to install FFMPEG library.
(otherwise, recording will not be available as playable flash element on the page)
